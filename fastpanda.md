# On Your Turn
On your turn you take up to **3 actions**. You can take the same action more than once and can do them in any order. Each action is described in greater detail later on.

**Actions**
 - **Draw** two cards
 - **Take** a card from Backstage
 - **Cue** a song from your hand onto the next open slot of your Board
 - **Swap** the position of two songs on your Board
 - **Move** a song on your Board to an empty slot
 - **Play** an action card from your hand
 
## Pleasing the Crowd
When you're done your turn, check the songs you have on your Board from left to right. If the colors match up with any of the crowd members you have *pleased that crowd member*. Gain the points in the top left of the crowd member, as well as any from +1 tokens on that member. If the songs you played were *In Sync* (described below), take the extra points in the top right of the card.

Discard the crowd member you've pleased and replace them with the next one from The Stands.

### In Sync
For a set of songs to be In Sync, the needle underneath the BPM can only move one space from one card to the next.

_graphic goes here_
    1->2->3    = In Sync  
    2->1->3    = Not In Sync  
    1->2->1->1 = In Sync


After resolving crowd members, **draw a card**.

#### Maximum Hand Size
If you have more than 7 cards in your hand after your turn is over, discard down to 7.

# The Actions

## Draw
Draw two cards from the top of the draw pile. Keep in mind your max hand size is 7, described above.

## Take
Take one of the faceup cards from the Backstage area and add it to your hand. Immediately replace it with the top card of the draw pile.

## Cue
Place one of the songs in your hand faceup in the first open spot on your board. If there are no open spots then you can first discard one of your cued songs and play the song in that spot.

## Swap
Take two cued songs from your Board and swap their positions.

## Move
Move one of your cued songs to any empty spot on your Board.

## Play
Play an action card from your hand. Resolve its ability, then discard the action card.
