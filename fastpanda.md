# On Your Turn
On your turn you take up to **2 actions**. You can take the same action more than once and can do them in any order. Each action is described in greater detail later on.

**Actions**
 - **Draw** a card
 - **Take** a card from Backstage
 - **Cue** a song from your hand onto the next open slot of your Board
 - **Swap** the position of two songs on your Board
 - **Move** a song on your Board to an empty slot
 - **Play** an action card from your hand
 
## Pleasing the Crowd
When you're done your turn, check the songs you have on your Board from left to right. 

Check your cued cards's colors and tempo from left to right. If they match the preferences listed on a crowd member you have pleased that crowd member.

### Example
Jane has cued the following cards

    [Red / BPM1] [Blue / BPM4] [Green / BPM2]

And one of the crowd members has these in a line:

    [Red] [BPM4] [Green]
    
Jane has please this crowd member as here first, second, and third cued songs match the crowd member's first, second, and third preferences.
    
### Loops vs Lines
Some crowd members have their preferences in a straight line, and others in a loop.

When the preferences are in a line, then the first song in your cue must match the first song in their list.

When the preferences are in a loop, then then first cued song can match any of their preferences. The rest of your songs must follow the clockwise order listed on the crowd member.

### Points Awards
When you please a crowd member, gain the points listed on that crowd member, as well as any from +1 tokens on that member. 

If the songs you played were *In Sync* (described below), gain the extra points as well.

Discard the crowd member you've pleased and replace them with the next one from The Stands.

#### In Sync Points Bonus
For a set of songs to be In Sync, the needle underneath the BPM can only move one space from one card to the next.

_graphic goes here_
    [X / BPM1] -> [X / BPM2] -> [X / BPM3] = In Sync  
    [X / BPM3] -> [X / BPM1] -> [X / BPM2] = Not In Sync  
    [X / BPM1] -> [X / BPM2] -> [X / BPM1] = In Sync


### Ending Your Turn
After pleasing crowd members, if any, **draw a card**.

#### Maximum Hand Size
If you have more than 7 cards in your hand after your turn is over, discard down to 7.

# The Actions

## Draw
Draw a card from the top of the draw pile. Keep in mind your max hand size is 7, described above.

## Take
Take one of the faceup cards from the Backstage area and add it to your hand. Immediately replace it with the top card of the draw pile.

## Cue
Place one of the songs in your hand faceup in the first open spot on your board. If there are no open spots then you can first discard one of your cued songs as a free action and play the song from hand into that spot.

## Swap
Take two cued songs from your Board and swap their positions.

## Move
Move one of your cued songs to any empty spot on your Board.

## Play
Play an action card from your hand. Resolve its ability, then discard the action card.

# Playing A Round
A round consists of each player taking a turn.

## Determining Turn Order

### Pick Starting Card
Each player picks one card from their hand and places it face down in their next available open spot on their board. If there are **no open** spots they must first discard the last song from their board.

### Reveal Starting Cards
Once everyone has picked a starting card, they are all revealed at once. Turn order is determined by the BPM of the cards played, with **lowest BPM going first** then the next lowest BPM, then the next and so on.

If there is a tie in BPM the player with the fewest points goes first. If there is still a tie, flip a coin (_Note: we should change this later_).

---

# Ending the Game
When the **second to last** crowd member in the Front Row has been pleased and there are no more crowd members in The Stands, then that is the **final round**. Play continues until every player has played their turn that round, then the turn is over.

## Determining the Winner
Every player counts up the points tokens they earned. Whoever has the most wins. If there is a tie, the player with the most crowd members pleased wins. If there is still a tie then it's a tie.
