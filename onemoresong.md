# DJ Duels With a Z

# Introduction
## Overview
You are all DJs sharing a stage for the final show of the tour. You'll need to feel out the crowd to play music they'll like, and get them dancing.

## Objective
The winner is the player with the most points at the end of 8 rounds. You play songs of certain colors to put your player token on dancers with that color preference, turning them into your fans. You gain points for having fans near the beachball at the end of the round. If you get 3 or more of your fans in a line, you get to keep 2 of them as superfans. Superfans are worth points at the end of the game.

# Setup

## Make the Stage
Turn the box upside and place the Stage board on top of it. Take the lid of the box and slide it upright under the back of the Stage.

## Make the Dancefloor
Shuffle the dancer tiles into a pile. Create a grid of face-up dancers based on the number of players:

|Players|Size|
|:--|:--|
|2|3x4|
|3|4x4|
|4|4x5|

Make this grid in front of the Stage.

Put the unused dancers in a face-down pile behind the crowd.

## Song Deck
Shuffle the song cards and place them on the Song slot on the Stage.

## Vibe Deck
Take the Vibe cards and remove the 2 Crowd Bonus cards. Shuffle the rest of the Vibe cards and set 2 aside without looking at them. Shuffle the 2 Crowd Bonus cards into the remaining Vibe cards, then place the random 2 that were set aside on top. Place this deck on the Vibes slot on the Stage.

## Tokens
Put the point tokens in an easily reachable pile on the table.

## Grab Player Tokens
Each player picks a token color and puts all tokens of that color in front of them.

## Pick Your Setlist
Each player draws 10 song cards. If you do not like your hand you can discard them all and draw 10 more. You may only do this once.
