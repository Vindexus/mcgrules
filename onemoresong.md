# DJ Duels With a Z

# Introduction
## Overview
You are all DJs sharing a stage for the final show of the tour. You'll need to feel out the crowd to play music they'll like. If you play the right music you can turn crowd members into fans. Get them to dance into the right formations and you'll turn fans into super fans!

## Objective
The winner is the player with the **most points** at the end of **8 rounds**. You will play songs to turn dancers into fans and gain points by:

 - Having fans near the beachball
 - Gaining fans of certain colors
 - Having fans in lines of 3 or more

# Setup

## Make the Stage
Turn the box upside and place the Stage board on top of it, with the reference side of the board hanging down the front. Take the lid of the box and slide it upright under the back of the Stage.

## Make the Dancefloor
Shuffle the dancer tiles into a pile. Create a grid of face-up dancers in front of the stage based on the number of players:

|Players|Size|
|:--|:--|
|2|3x4|
|3|4x4|
|4|4x5|

### Layouts
Cells with 2+ are used in games with 2 or more players, 3+ for 3 or more players, 4+ for 4 or more players.

|-|-|-|-|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|2+|2+|2+|3+|
|2+|2+|2+|3+|
|2+|2+|2+|3+|
|2+|2+|2+|3+|
|4+|4+|4+|4+|

Put the unused dancers in a face-down pile behind the dancefloor, opposite the Stage. This will form the **dancer draw pile**.

## Song Deck
Shuffle the song cards and place them on the Songs slot on the Stage.

## Effects Deck
Search the Effects deck for the 2 Crowd Bonus cards and set them aside. Shuffle the rest of the Effect cards and set 2 aside without looking at them. Shuffle the 2 Crowd Bonus cards into the remaining Effect cards, then place the random 2 that were set aside on top. Place this deck on the Effect slot on the Stage.

|Card #|Contents|
|:--|:--|
|1-2|Random without Crowd Bonus|
|3-8|Random including Crowd Bonus|

## Tokens
Put the point tokens in an easily reachable pile on the table.

## Grab Player Tokens
Each player picks a token color and puts all tokens of that color in front of them.

## Pick Your Setlist
Each player draws 10 song cards. If you do not like your hand you can discard them all and draw 10 more. You may only do this once.
