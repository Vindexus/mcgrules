### 2. Cue Songs
Each player secretly chooses a song from their hand and holds it face down in front of them.

### 3. Reveal Song Cards (The Drop!)
Once all players have cued a song, count down "3..2..1... Drop!" and all players reveal their cued song on the Drop.

The player(s) with the most fans next to the Beachball each gain 1 random superfan from the top of the dancer draw pile.

### 6. Check for Combos
In the same order that players took their turns, players will award combos (described later).

### 7. Move Beachball
Move the Beachball twice. The Beachball moves in the direction of the dancer whose arrow  is closest to the Beachball. If the Beachball would move off the edge of the dance floor, loop it around to the other side of the dance floor.

The arrow to use will always be the dancer's who is down and to the right of the Beachball.

The Beachball should always be surrounded by 4 dancers.

#### 1. Look for Lines
Check if you have 3 or more of *your* fans in a line: down, across, or diagonally. If you do that is called a Combo. It is possible to have more than one combo. It is possible for a fan to be a part of more than one Combo.

Pick one fan across all of your Combos to remain on the board. Keep the others as **superfans** in front of you. They are worth points at the end of the game.

#### 3. Fill Dance Floor
Move all dancers forward towards the stage to fill in any gaps. Draw new dancers to fill in the dancefloor back to its original size.

# Frequently Asked Questions

#### If I use the Bathroom Break effect to remove an empty dancer, can I place my token on the newly revealed dancer?
Yes.


#### What happens if I run out of tokens?
At the start of your turn you may discard one of your dancers to get its token. You will _not_ gain the fan as a superfan. Fill the Dancefloor immediately after collecting your token.
