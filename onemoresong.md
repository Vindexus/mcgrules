Turn the box upside and place the Stage board on top of it. Hang the reference side of the board down the front. Take the lid of the box and slide it upright under the back of the Stage.

## Make the Dancefloor
Shuffle the dancer tiles into a pile. Create a grid of face-up dancers in front of the stage based on the number of players:

|Players|Size|
|:--|:--|

Put the unused dancers in a face-down pile behind the dancefloor, opposite the Stage. This will form the **dancer draw pile**.

Shuffle the song cards and place them on the Songs slot on the Stage.

## Hype Deck
Create the Hype deck by finding 4 random Hype cards with the X icon. Place them on Hype section of the Stage, then place the Beachball Bop card on top facedown. Find 3 random Hype cards with the Y icon and put them on top. Put the remainder of the Hype cards aside.


|Card #|Contents|

Then all players will **reveal** their cued song.

Then in order of lowest BPM to highest BPM players will take their turn **playing their song** (explained later)

After all players have had their turn, the player or players with the most fans touching the **Beachball** gain 1 random superfan.
