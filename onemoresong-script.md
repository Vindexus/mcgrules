# Script for Teaching the Game
When teaching the game first set up the dancefloor then explain the following:

## Who You Are
You are all DJs playing a live show to the dancers on the dance floor.

## What You Do
Play song cards to turn dancers into fans and move them around the dance floor.

## How You Win
Your goal is to have the most points by the end of 8 rounds. You gain points by gaining the most **superfans** which you get by:

 - Having lines of 3 or more of your fans on the dance floor at the end of round (down, across, diagonally)
 - Having your fans in certain positions on the dance floor

## Round Overview
Each of the 8 rounds will flow like so:

First, the **Hypemaster** will draw 2 Hype cards and choose one. The Hype card will slightly change how that round is played.

All players **cue up a song** by holding it facedown in front of them

Then all players will **reveal** their cued song.

Then in order of lowest BPM to highest BPM players will take their turn **playing their song** (explained later)

After all players have had their turn, the player or players with the most fans touching the **Beachball** gain 1 random superfan.

In the same order they played their songs, players will **check for combos** (explained later)

The **Hype deck moves** to the player to the left to start the next round.

## Playing Songs
On your turn you will perform an Action and/or a Placement.

### Action
Each song has one of two action types.

#### Movement
Move dancers based on the arrows on your song  

##### Up/Down and Left/Right
Move a dancer by swapping it with the one in the direction you are moving.  
The direction of the arrows is relative to the front of the dance floor.

##### Hop
Swap a dancer with dancer two spots away, non-diagonally. The dancer in between will not move.

#### Bathroom Break
Remove an empty dancer then fill the dance floor

### Placement
Place a token on an empty dancer with a color matching your song  
**If you moved** a dancer you can only place on a dancer you moved with a color matching your song

## Check for Combos
